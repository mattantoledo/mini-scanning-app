# Mini Scanning App

This is my first React app, which I created during a React Workshop in CS TAU Students Club, offered by [@danielsuissa](https://github.com/daniel-suissa) from Sentra.

I also deployed this app to Firebase! Check it out [here](https://mini-scanning-app-c643c.web.app).

Instructions:
1. Enter a bucket name
2. Press "SCAN NOW"
3. See what happens

Have fun!
